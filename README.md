## About The Project

As AI-generated imagery becomes increasingly sophisticated and widespread, the ability to discern synthetic media from authentic photographs is crucial. This project provides a reliable solution by implementing a deep learning model to classify images as either `Real` or `AI-Generated`.

The core of this detector is **EfficientNet-B7**, a convolutional neural network known for its exceptional accuracy and computational efficiency. The model has been fine-tuned on a diverse dataset of real and AI-generated pictures to identify subtle artifacts and patterns unique to synthetic images.

## Model Architecture 🔬

This project uses **EfficientNet**, a family of models developed by Google AI. Unlike traditional approaches that scale network dimensions (width, depth, or resolution) arbitrarily, EfficientNet employs a **compound scaling method**. This method uniformly scales all three dimensions with a fixed set of scaling coefficients, leading to a much better balance between accuracy and computational cost.

We specifically chose **EfficientNet-B7** because it represents the upper end of the EfficientNet family, providing the highest accuracy with manageable resource requirements for this classification task.
